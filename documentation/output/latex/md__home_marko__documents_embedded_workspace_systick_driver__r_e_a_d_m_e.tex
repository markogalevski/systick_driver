A general wrapper around systick and systick-\/like features to allow for general timekeeping and timeout functionality to other elements of the H\+AL.

\subsection*{Note\+:}

The systick and sysclock elements of the H\+AL are some of the most difficult to use and test, and are generally wrappers around M\+CU vendor created functions, or reimplementations thereof with more freedom (but {\bfseries S\+T\+R\+O\+NG} recommendations). If you have A\+NY doubts about my implementations or experience issues, redirect the interface targets to H\+A\+Ls created by the vendors.
